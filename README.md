# Analysis And Design of Algorithms (Semester 5)

Hi Guys ✌️

This is repository I'm trying to explain all the algorithms in our ADA syllabus and also their implementation in python in as simple way as possible

So, Please go through them.

- If you feel like you are not able to understand some algorithm that I wrote or
- If you feel like this explanation for this algorithm is difficult or
- The code that I wrote is too advanced and not able to get it.

Then Feel free to [message me](https://wa.me/917981754157?text=Hi%20Hari%20I%20have%20just%20seen%20your%20repository%20and%20I%20am%20not%20able%20to%20understand%20--metion%20your%20algorithm%20here--). I will try to simply that algorithm even better.
